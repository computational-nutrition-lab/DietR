These R scripts were copied from 

C:\Users\sadoh\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\DietR\users.

So that the R scripts and the output will be close (in the same folder).

These R scripts are not likely to be used again because the ANCOVA models used is old (uses 
PROT, FIBER as covariates).

But when running them again, need to change the paths in the script based on their current locations.
