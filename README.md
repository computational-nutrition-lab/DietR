## Memorandom of how to update my GitHub page.

1. Open up the R project file in the folder for your repo on your local computer (.rproj file)
2. Edit the .rmd files in R-studio3
3. Recompile website (build website when index.rmd is loaded), or knit individual .rmd files. This will produce a .html file in the /docs folder. 
4. Send your changes back to the online github repository. Wait a couple seconds, your changes should now be served on your website.
