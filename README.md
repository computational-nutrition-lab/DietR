## Welcome to DietR, a toolkit for ASA24 and NHANES data analysis with R.

## The repo contains:
1. "eg_data" folder with example datasets that can be used to follow the tutorials on the website.
2. "lib" folder with source functions that are to be called within the scripts. DietR users do not normally need to directly edit the functions. 
3. "users" folder with R scripts that contain annotated R code to analyze ASA24 or NHANES data.
